Educational project for students to perform code reviewing tasks.

The code was bugged and made awful on purpose. Students are to find these bugs and make suggestions towards code refactoring at formal inspections. The code is supposed to model laboratory work passing process for the students and teacher using queueing theory.

If you'd like to add more ugly code and its development experience - you are welcome to contribute!
